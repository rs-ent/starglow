## Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** (for external contributors) or **create a branch** (for team members)

   - Branch naming convention: `feature/description`, `bugfix/description`, or `docs/description`

2. **Set up your development environment**

   - Clone the repository
   - Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
   - Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`

3. **Make your changes**

   - Write clean, well-commented code
   - Keep commits small and focused

4. **Test your changes**

   - Run `yarn lint` to check for code style issues

   - Test any new functionality thoroughly

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Create a pull request to the `main` branch
   - Provide a clear description of the changes
   - Reference any related issues

## Pull Request Process
